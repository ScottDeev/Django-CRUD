# Django-CRUD

#A Zuri task.

#What it does
This is a simple blog site using django for the backend. It allows users to write, view, update and delete post.

#Things I learnt on this project
I was able to understand how Django CRUD works.
CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete. 
Apart from understanding CRUD, I was still able to cement my knowledge of MVT which is Model View Template

#Appreciation
I thank Zuri and all the tutors that are helping me get a good knowledge on how Django works.
Looking forward to more of the task
